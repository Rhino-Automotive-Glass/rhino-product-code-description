-- ============================================
-- Let users with audit history (or who granted roles) be deleted
-- ============================================
-- Checked against the LIVE database (2026-09-19) before writing.
--
-- audit_logs.user_id was declared NOT NULL but its foreign key says
-- ON DELETE SET NULL (migration 004). The two contradict each other, so
-- deleting any auth user who ever appears in audit_logs failed:
--   null value in column "user_id" of relation "audit_logs" violates
--   not-null constraint
-- 35 audit rows exist, so those users could not be deleted. It is the only
-- NOT NULL + SET NULL foreign key in the database.
--
-- Allow NULL, keeping ON DELETE SET NULL: the audit trail survives a user's
-- deletion, and user_email (still NOT NULL, copied at write time) keeps
-- recording who acted. The alternative, ON DELETE RESTRICT, would block
-- user deletion outright; CASCADE would erase audit history.
--
-- Dropping NOT NULL alone is not enough: deleting the user cascades to their
-- user_roles / user_permissions rows, whose audit triggers then log the
-- deleted user as the actor (log_role_change falls back to OLD.user_id,
-- log_permission_override_change to the subject). That audit row references
-- a user who no longer exists and fails the foreign key. Both triggers now
-- record NULL for an actor that no longer exists. Only those lines change;
-- the rest is the live definition (rhino-access migration 012) verbatim.
--
-- NOTE for rhino-access: both functions come from its migration 012. Port
-- this change there, or a later migration re-creating them would revert it.

ALTER TABLE public.audit_logs ALTER COLUMN user_id DROP NOT NULL;

COMMENT ON COLUMN public.audit_logs.user_id IS
  'Acting user. NULL once that user has been deleted (FK ON DELETE SET NULL); user_email still identifies them.';

-- --------------------------------------------
-- "Granted by" links: clear instead of blocking the delete
-- --------------------------------------------
-- user_roles.assigned_by and user_permissions.granted_by referenced
-- auth.users with no delete rule, so anyone who ever assigned a role or
-- granted an override could not be deleted either. Both columns are
-- nullable; the role / override itself stays, only the link is cleared.
-- (Clearing fires the UPDATE audit triggers, which then attribute the change
-- to the subject user — who still exists.)
